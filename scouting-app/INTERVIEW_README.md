Once you have selected them by clicking on their row, click the button below the player list titled "Compare! 2/2 Selected". You are allowed to search for other players through the search bar and their will persistence on your choices. Clicking the button will take you to a new page where you are able to look at the statistics of both players with a bar graph comparing the per 90 stat and the other a radar graph comparing the percentile in each statistic.

You may click either button to return back to the players list.

### Clicking a player while NOT in Compare Mode
Clicking a player while not in "Compare Mode" will show you his individual stats as well as a radar graph plotting the percentiles in each of the statistics, quickly showing the players strengths and weaknesses.
